# Claude Code VIBE prompts

## Setup

- Create DOC/SPEC.md that sumerises and indexes all of the other md files in DOC/MVP/ and DOC/WORLD
- Create DOC/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md that breaks down each phase and step in order to create the MVP. Make the phaeses and steps as small as possable for ease of implementaion and emphasise testeing, documentation and git management with tags.
- I have created a git repo at git@github.com:MineForeman/veyrm.git, create an appropriate gitignore and do the first check in.

## Step

- Detail what is needed to complete 0.1 Initialize Repository in its own document.
- Implement the items in 0.1 Initialize Repository document.
