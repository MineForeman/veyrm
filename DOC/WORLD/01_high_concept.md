# 01 — High Concept

- **Premise:** A broken world sealed by a fallen crown. Beneath the citadel-ruin of **Veyrmspire** coils the **Spiral Vaults**—one hundred descending rings dug through eras by empires, cults, and the **Never-King**. Heroes descend to shatter the last shard that binds the crown and end the age of night-mines.
- **Play Loop:** Prepare in surface towns → descend a few rings → return (or perish) → craft, pledge to Orders, push deeper. The Vaults are semi-living; stairs shift between delves, secrets remember you.
- **Tone:** Copper-age grit meets luminous mysticism. Iron and ink. Little whimsy, but sparks of wonder.
