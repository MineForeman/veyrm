- [Implementing a System](systems.md)

### Debugging
- Enable debug mode: `--debug` flag
- Check logs: `logs/veyrm_debug.log`
- Run tests: `./build.sh test`
- Profile: See [Profiling Guide](../../development/performance/profiling.md)

## Best Practices

### Code Quality
- Follow [Code Style Guide](../../development/standards/code-style.md)
- Write tests for new features
- Document public APIs
- Handle errors gracefully

### Development Process
1. Create feature branch
2. Write tests first (TDD)
3. Implement feature
4. Update documentation
5. Submit pull request

## Resources
