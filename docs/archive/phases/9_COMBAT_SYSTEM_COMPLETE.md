# Phase 9: Combat System - Complete Documentation

## Overview

Phase 9 implements a complete d20-based combat system for Veyrm, including melee combat, death handling, and comprehensive combat logging. The system integrates seamlessly with the monster AI from Phase 8.3 to create engaging tactical combat.

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All three sub-phases have been successfully implemented and tested:
- Phase 9.1: Combat Stats ✅
- Phase 9.2: Bump Combat ✅
- Phase 9.3: Death Handling ✅

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **CombatSystem** (`include/combat_system.h`, `src/combat_system.cpp`)
   - Central combat resolution engine
   - d20 attack roll mechanics
   - Damage calculation and application
   - Combat message generation

2. **Entity Combat Interface** (`include/entity.h`)
   - Base combat stats (hp, max_hp)
   - Virtual combat methods for polymorphic behavior
   - Attack/defense bonuses and damage calculations

3. **Player Combat** (`include/player.h`, `src/player.cpp`)
   - Player-specific combat stats (attack, defense)
   - Experience gain from combat
   - Death handling

4. **Monster Combat** (`include/monster.h`)
   - Monster-specific combat stats
   - XP value for rewards
   - Threat level system

## Combat Mechanics

### d20 Combat System

The combat system uses a d20 (20-sided die) mechanic inspired by tabletop RPGs:

```cpp
Attack Roll = 1d20 + Attacker's Attack Bonus
Defense Value = 10 + Defender's Defense Bonus

if (Attack Roll >= Defense Value) -> HIT
else -> MISS
```

### Special Cases

- **Critical Hit**: Natural 20 (5% chance)
  - Always hits regardless of defense
  - Deals double damage

- **Critical Miss**: Natural 1 (5% chance)
  - Always misses regardless of attack bonus

### Damage Calculation

```cpp
Base Damage = Random(1, Attacker's Base Damage)
Final Damage = max(1, Base Damage - Defender's Defense Bonus)

On Critical Hit:
Final Damage = Final Damage * 2
```

### Combat Flow

1. **Player Attacks Monster** (Bump Combat)
   - Player moves into monster's position
   - `handlePlayerMovement()` detects collision
   - `CombatSystem::processAttack()` resolves combat
   - Messages added to game log
   - If monster dies: removed from map, XP awarded

2. **Monster Attacks Player** (AI Combat)
   - Monster AI decides to attack
   - `MonsterAI::executeAttack()` initiates combat
   - `CombatSystem::processAttack()` resolves combat
   - Messages added to game log
   - If player dies: death screen displayed

## Death Handling

### Player Death
- Triggers when HP reaches 0
- Game state changes to `GameState::DEATH`
- Death screen displayed with options:
  - [R] Return to Menu
  - [Q] Quit Game
- Death logged with ERROR level for visibility

### Monster Death
- Entity removed from EntityManager
- Experience points awarded to player
- Death message displayed in combat log
- Monster's space becomes walkable

## Logging System

### Log Levels
- **ERROR**: Critical events (player death)
- **WARN**: Important warnings
- **INFO**: General information
- **DEBUG**: Detailed debugging
- **TRACE**: Very detailed tracing

### Log Categories
- **COMBAT**: Combat calculations and results
- **AI**: Monster AI decisions
- **MOVEMENT**: Entity movement
- **SYSTEM**: System events

### Combat Log Format
```
[COMBAT] === COMBAT START ===
[COMBAT] Attacker: You (HP: 50/50)
[COMBAT] Defender: Gutter Rat (HP: 3/3)
[COMBAT] Raw d20 roll: 15
[COMBAT] Attack bonus: 8
[COMBAT] Total attack roll: 23
[COMBAT] Defense value: 10
[COMBAT] Hit result: HIT (23 vs 10)
[COMBAT] Base damage calculated: 6
[COMBAT] Damage to apply: 6
[COMBAT] Defender HP after: 0/3
[COMBAT] Fatal: YES
[COMBAT] === COMBAT END ===
```

## Configuration

Combat stats are configurable via `config.yml`:

```yaml
# Player starting stats
player_starting_hp: 50
player_starting_attack: 8
player_starting_defense: 5

# Combat constants (in CombatSystem)
BASE_DEFENSE: 10
MIN_DAMAGE: 1
CRITICAL_HIT_THRESHOLD: 20
CRITICAL_MISS_THRESHOLD: 1
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- `test_combat_system.cpp`: Core combat mechanics
- Player vs Monster combat scenarios
- Critical hit/miss edge cases
- Damage calculation verification
- Death state transitions

### Integration Testing
- Bump-to-attack functionality
- Combat message display
- Monster AI combat integration
- Death screen transitions

### Manual Testing Commands
```bash
# Test with automated input
./build.sh keys '\njjjhhhhq'  # Move and attack

# Test with frame dump
./build.sh dump '\njjjq'  # Visual debugging

# Check combat logs
tail -f logs/veyrm_debug.log | grep COMBAT
```

## Files Modified

### New Files Created
- `include/combat_system.h` - Combat system interface
- `src/combat_system.cpp` - Combat implementation
- `include/log.h` - Logging system interface
- `src/log.cpp` - Logging implementation
- `tests/test_combat_system.cpp` - Combat unit tests

### Modified Files
- `include/entity.h` - Added combat interface
- `include/player.h` - Removed duplicate HP members
- `src/player.cpp` - Fixed HP initialization
- `src/game_screen.cpp` - Added handlePlayerMovement()
- `src/game_manager.cpp` - Added death handling
- `src/main.cpp` - Added death screen, logging init
- `src/monster_ai.cpp` - Integrated combat attacks
- `include/config.h` - Updated player stats

## Known Issues and Future Improvements

### Current Limitations
- Combat is melee-only (no ranged attacks)
- No combat animations or delays
- No dodge or parry mechanics
- No status effects (poison, stun, etc.)

### Potential Enhancements
- Weapon and armor system
- Combat skills and abilities
- Multi-target attacks
- Combat formations and positioning
- Critical hit tables with special effects

## Performance Metrics

- Combat resolution: < 1ms per attack
- Log file I/O: Buffered for performance
- Memory usage: Minimal (combat results are transient)
- No memory leaks detected in testing

## Conclusion

Phase 9 successfully implements a complete, functional combat system that provides the foundation for engaging roguelike gameplay. The d20 mechanics offer good randomness while maintaining strategic depth, and the comprehensive logging system makes debugging and balancing straightforward.

The combat system is fully integrated with monster AI, player controls, and the game's UI, creating a cohesive combat experience that's ready for further content and feature additions.
