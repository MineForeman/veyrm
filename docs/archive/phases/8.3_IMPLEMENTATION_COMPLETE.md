- **Intelligent Pursuit**: Smart pathfinding around obstacles
- **Tactical Retreat**: Fleeing adds depth to combat encounters

## 🔄 Integration Points

### Game Systems
- **Turn System**: AI updates occur during world turn phase
- **Spawn System**: Automatic room assignment during monster creation
- **Combat System**: Ready for integration with existing bump-to-attack
- **FOV System**: Reuses player FOV calculations for monster vision

### Data Flow
1. **Player Action** → Turn Manager processes
2. **World Turn** → Monster AI updates all active monsters
3. **AI Processing** → State evaluation and pathfinding
4. **Movement Execution** → Collision detection and position updates
5. **Combat Resolution** → Damage calculation and health updates

## 📋 Configuration Options

### AI Parameters (Configurable)
```cpp
static const int DEFAULT_VISION_RANGE = 8;
static const int ALERT_RANGE = 10;
static const int HOSTILE_RANGE = 8;
static const int MEMORY_TURNS = 5;
static const int RETURN_THRESHOLD = 15;
```

### Monster-Specific Settings
- **Vision Range**: Per-species detection distance
- **Aggression**: Behavior tendency settings
- **Room Binding**: Territorial vs. roaming monsters
- **Door Opening**: Species-specific abilities
- **Flee Threshold**: Health percentage for retreat

## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

### Design Patterns
