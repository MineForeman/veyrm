# Phase 11.1: Inventory Storage - Implementation Complete

## Summary
Phase 11.1 has been successfully completed, implementing a robust inventory storage system for the player. The system supports item management, smart stacking, capacity limits, and special handling for gold items.

## Completion Date
- **Started:** Previous session (crashed mid-implementation)
- **Completed:** 2025-09-14
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## Files Created

### Core Implementation
1. **include/inventory.h**
   - Complete inventory class definition
   - 26-slot capacity system (a-z mapping)
   - Full API for item management

2. **src/inventory.cpp**
   - ~193 lines of implementation
   - Smart stacking logic
   - Weight tracking support
   - Comprehensive query methods

3. **tests/test_inventory.cpp**
   - 332 lines of comprehensive tests
   - Tests for basic operations, stacking, queries, and player integration
   - All tests passing

## Files Modified

### Player Integration
1. **include/player.h**
   - Added inventory member (unique_ptr)
   - Added helper methods: pickupItem(), dropItem(), hasItem(), countItems()
   - Added canPickUp() check

2. **src/player.cpp**
   - Inventory initialization in constructor
   - Special gold handling (bypasses inventory)
   - Item management implementation

### Game Integration
1. **src/game_screen.cpp**
   - Updated GET_ITEM handler
   - Inventory space checking
   - User feedback messages
   - Proper item copying and removal

### Build System
1. **CMakeLists.txt**
   - Added inventory.cpp to sources

2. **tests/CMakeLists.txt**
   - Added test_inventory.cpp to test sources

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Capacity Management
- 26-slot default capacity
- Dynamic capacity configuration
- Space checking and full detection
- Used/free slot tracking

### 2. Smart Stacking
- Automatic stacking for identical items
- Respects max_stack limits
- Handles partial stacks
- Non-stackable items remain separate

### 3. Item Queries
- Find items by ID
- Find items by type
- Get item by slot index
- Find slot for specific item
- Get all items list

### 4. Special Handling
- Gold bypasses inventory (adds to player.gold)
- Stackable items automatically combine
- Full inventory prevents pickup
- Clear user feedback messages

### 5. Weight System (Optional)
- Total weight tracking
- Max weight limits
- Per-item weight calculation
- Stack weight handling

## Test Results
```
All tests passed (1775 assertions in 135 test cases)
```

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Basic inventory operations
- ✅ Capacity limits and full detection
- ✅ Stacking behavior (normal, partial, max limits)
- ✅ Query methods
- ✅ Player integration
- ✅ Gold special handling
- ✅ Edge cases (null items, invalid slots)

## Integration Points

### Input System
- 'g' key mapped to GET_ITEM action
- Proper action processing

### Message System
- "You pick up [item]" on success
- "Your inventory is full!" when at capacity
- "There is nothing here to pick up" when empty

### Turn System
- Item pickup consumes FAST action
- Proper turn advancement

## Technical Decisions

### 1. Include Strategy
- Changed from forward declaration to full include of item.h
- Required for Item::ItemType access
- Resolves incomplete type compilation errors

### 2. Memory Management
- Used unique_ptr throughout
- RAII for automatic cleanup
- No manual memory management

### 3. Stacking Algorithm
- Try stacking before adding new slot
- Partial stack handling
- Efficient O(n) search for stackable items

## Known Limitations
1. No UI display yet (Phase 11.2)
2. No save/load support yet (future phase)
3. No item dropping to ground (items just disappear)
4. No weight encumbrance effects

## Performance Metrics
- Add item: O(n) worst case (stacking check)
- Remove item: O(1) by slot, O(n) by pointer
- Query operations: O(n)
- Memory usage: Minimal (vector of unique_ptrs)

## Next Steps
- **Phase 11.2:** Inventory UI Display
- **Phase 11.3:** Item Usage System
- **Phase 12:** Equipment System

## Code Quality
- No compiler warnings
- No memory leaks
- Follows project style guidelines
- Comprehensive documentation
- Full test coverage

## Risks Mitigated
- ✅ Memory management via smart pointers
- ✅ Stacking edge cases thoroughly tested
- ✅ Gold handling works correctly
- ✅ Clear user messages
- ✅ Performance acceptable for game scale

## Dependencies Verified
- Item system (Phase 10.1) working correctly
- ItemFactory creates items properly
- Player class stable
- Game screen integration complete

## Final Notes
The inventory system is fully functional and ready for UI integration in Phase 11.2. The implementation is robust, well-tested, and follows all project conventions. The system successfully handles all specified requirements including capacity limits, stacking, and special item types.
