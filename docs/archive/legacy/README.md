# Legacy Documentation

Archive of deprecated or historical documentation.

## Purpose

This directory contains documentation that is:

- No longer current but historically significant
- Deprecated but may be referenced
- Superseded by newer documentation
- Experimental ideas that weren't implemented

## Contents

(Currently empty - ready for future archival)

## Archival Policy

Documents are moved here when they:

1. Describe features that have been removed
2. Document approaches that were replaced
3. Contain outdated information but have historical value
4. Reference old versions of the codebase

## Note

Before referencing documentation in this directory, check if there's a current version in the main documentation tree.
