## Architecture Highlights 🏗️

### Component-Based Design
```
GameManager
├── Map (198x66 tiles)
├── EntityManager
│   ├── Player
│   └── Monsters
├── TurnManager
├── CombatSystem
├── ItemManager
├── InventorySystem
└── GameSerializer
```

### Data-Driven Content
- `monsters.json` - Monster definitions
- `items.json` - Item definitions
- Save files in JSON format

### Build System
```bash
./build.sh build    # Build game
./build.sh test     # Run tests
./build.sh run      # Play game
./build.sh dump     # Debug output
./build.sh keys     # Automated testing
```

## Playing the Game 🎯

### Controls
- **Arrow Keys/Numpad**: Movement
- **g**: Get item
- **i**: Open inventory
- **u**: Use item
- **D**: Drop item
- **E**: Examine item
- **S**: Save game
- **L**: Load game
- **o**: Open/close doors
- **.**: Wait
- **q**: Quit

### Starting
```bash
./build/bin/veyrm
```

## Future Beyond MVP 🚀

While the MVP is complete, the foundation supports:
- More monster types and AI behaviors
- Expanded item system (weapons, armor, scrolls)
- Character progression and stats
- Multiple dungeon levels
- Quests and storyline
- Settings and configuration
- Achievements system
- And much more!

## Technical Debt Addressed ✨
- Proper memory management with smart pointers
- Comprehensive error handling
- Extensive logging system
- Modular architecture
- Clean separation of concerns
- Data-driven design

## Acknowledgments 🙏
This MVP represents a solid foundation for a modern roguelike, combining classic gameplay with modern C++ practices and architecture.

## Preservation
This MVP state is preserved in:
- **Tag**: `v1.0.0-MVP`
- **Branch**: `mvp-milestone`
