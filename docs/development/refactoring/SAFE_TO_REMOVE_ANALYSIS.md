# DOC Directory Removal Safety Analysis

## Summary

Analysis of what can be safely removed from the DOC/ directory after migration to docs/

## Files That MUST BE KEPT

### 1. DOC/VIBE.md

- **Status**: DO NOT DELETE
- **Reason**: User's personal notes file (per CLAUDE.md instructions)
- **Action**: Keep in DOC/

### 2. DOC/REFACTORING/*

- **Status**: KEEP FOR NOW
- **Reason**: Active refactoring documentation
- **Files**:
  - DOCUMENTATION_IMPROVEMENTS.md
  - DOCUMENTATION_REFACTORING_PHASE2.md
  - PHASE2_MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md
  - REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md
  - SAFE_TO_REMOVE_ANALYSIS.md (this file)
- **Action**: Keep until refactoring is complete

## Files SAFE TO REMOVE (Already Migrated)

### Core Documentation (Migrated to docs/)

All these files have been copied to new locations and are safe to remove:

| Original File | Migrated To | Safe to Remove |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| DOC/ARCHITECTURE.md | docs/guides/developer/architecture.md | ✅ |
| DOC/CONTROLS.md | docs/getting-started/controls.md | ✅ |
| DOC/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md | docs/guides/developer/setup.md | ✅ |
| DOC/CODE_STYLE_GUIDE.md | docs/development/standards/code-style.md | ✅ |
| DOC/CURRENT_STATE.md | docs/project/status.md | ✅ |
| DOC/PERFORMANCE_BENCHMARKS.md | docs/development/performance/benchmarks.md | ✅ |
| DOC/API_DOCUMENTATION.md | docs/reference/api/api-setup.md | ✅ |
| DOC/BUILD_SCRIPT.md | docs/reference/commands/build-script.md | ✅ |
| DOC/CONFIGURATION.md | docs/reference/configuration/game-config.md | ✅ |
| DOC/LOGGING_SYSTEM.md | docs/development/logging.md | ✅ |
| DOC/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md | docs/development/roadmap/implementation-plan.md | ✅ |
| DOC/AI_ARCHITECTURE.md | docs/design/architecture/systems/ai-architecture.md | ✅ |
| DOC/DOOR_SYSTEM.md | docs/design/specifications/door-system.md | ✅ |
| DOC/FEATURES.md | docs/project/features.md | ✅ |
| DOC/SPEC.md | docs/design/specifications/original-spec.md | ✅ |
| DOC/TESTS.md | docs/development/standards/testing.md | ✅ |
| DOC/TESTING_CATCH_UP_PLAN.md | docs/development/testing-plan.md | ✅ |
| DOC/RENDERING_IMPROVEMENTS.md | docs/development/performance/rendering-improvements.md | ✅ |
| DOC/VISUALIZATION_OPTIONS.md | docs/design/specifications/visualization-options.md | ✅ |
| DOC/MVP_COMPLETE.md | docs/archive/mvp-complete.md | ✅ |
| DOC/ARCHITECTURE/ITEM_SYSTEM.md | docs/design/architecture/systems/item-system.md | ✅ |
| DOC/FEATURES/LIT_ROOMS.md | docs/design/specifications/lit-rooms.md | ✅ |

### Directories Safe to Remove (All Contents Migrated)

1. **DOC/MVP/** - All files migrated to docs/archive/mvp/
2. **DOC/PHASES/** - All files migrated to docs/archive/phases/
3. **DOC/WORLD/** - All files migrated to docs/design/world/
4. **DOC/ARCHIVE/** - All files migrated to docs/archive/
5. **DOC/ARCHITECTURE/** - Files migrated to docs/design/architecture/systems/
6. **DOC/FEATURES/** - Files migrated to docs/design/specifications/

### Navigation Files (Superseded)

- **DOC/README.md** - Replaced by docs/README.md (safe to remove)

## Removal Commands (When Ready)

**IMPORTANT**: Only run these after confirming the migration is complete and working!

```bash
# Step 1: Remove migrated files (keeping VIBE.md and REFACTORING/)
find DOC -type f -name "*.md" | grep -v "VIBE.md" | grep -v "REFACTORING/" | xargs rm

# Step 2: Remove empty directories
find DOC -type d -empty -delete

# Step 3: Verify what remains
ls -la DOC/
# Should only show:
# - VIBE.md
# - REFACTORING/ directory
```

## Verification Checklist

Before removing DOC files:

- [x] All documentation accessible in docs/
- [x] Main README updated with new paths
- [x] No broken links to DOC/ in codebase
- [x] CI/CD still works
- [x] Tests still pass
- [x] VIBE.md identified as keep
- [x] Refactoring docs identified as keep

## Risk Assessment

- **Low Risk**: Removing already-migrated files (copies exist in docs/)
- **No Risk**: Files were copied, not moved (originals still in git history)
- **Protected**: VIBE.md and REFACTORING/ explicitly excluded

## Recommendation

It is SAFE to remove the DOC directory EXCEPT for:

1. DOC/VIBE.md (user's personal notes)
2. DOC/REFACTORING/* (active refactoring documentation)

All other files have been successfully migrated to the docs/ structure.
