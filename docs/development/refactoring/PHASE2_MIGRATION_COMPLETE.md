### Main README Updated

- Updated all documentation links to point to new `docs/` structure
- Organized links into logical sections:
  - Quick Links (getting started, guides)
  - Additional Resources (reference, design)
- Removed outdated DOC/ references

### Benefits Achieved

1. **Standard Structure** - Follows industry conventions (`docs/` lowercase)
2. **Better Organization** - Logical grouping by purpose and audience
3. **Improved Discovery** - Clear hierarchy and navigation
4. **GitHub Pages Ready** - Can now easily publish documentation
5. **Tool Compatibility** - Works with documentation generators

### Files Intentionally Not Migrated

- `DOC/VIBE.md` - User's personal notes (per CLAUDE.md instructions)
- `DOC/README.md` - Old navigation file (superseded by docs/README.md)
- `DOC/REFACTORING/*` - Active refactoring documentation (keep in DOC/)

### Next Steps

1. **Cleanup** (Optional)
   - Remove empty DOC/ subdirectories
   - Archive original DOC/ structure
   - Update any remaining code references

2. **Enhancement** (Future)
   - Add search functionality
   - Generate documentation site
   - Add version tagging
   - Implement link checking

3. **Maintenance**
   - Keep navigation READMEs updated
   - Maintain consistent naming
   - Regular link validation

## Validation Checklist

- [x] All important docs migrated
- [x] Directory structure created
- [x] Navigation READMEs exist
- [x] Main README updated
- [x] Links updated to new paths
- [x] Original files preserved (copied, not moved)
- [x] Build still works
- [x] Tests still pass

## Impact

- Documentation is now more accessible and professional
- Ready for documentation site generation
- Easier onboarding for new contributors
- Clear separation of concerns
- Scalable for future growth
