# 02 — Cosmology & Myth

- **The Crown and the Chain** – When the astrosmith deity **Kaldrith** died mid-forge, their circlet shattered into **Seven Shards**. Each shard clamps reality like a chain link. The shard buried beneath Veyrmspire fell into the hands of a mortal tyrant who rose as the **Never-King**.
- **The Loom** – Magic is the “grain” of reality, a warp-and-weft called the **Loom**. Mages shape it; priests entreat the **Lumens** (saints/small gods) who ride its currents. Paladins hammer oaths into it, making edges that cut the unreal.
- **The Breaking** – Every century the shard pulses; stone flows, paths rotate, and monsters molt into harder castes. Veterans call these pulses **Depth-Thaws**.
