# 06 — The Spiral Vaults (Megadungeon)

One hundred rings, each a theme-shift. Stairs are **turning stairs**—they do not always align between delves.

### Rings 1–10: The Woundworks
Rubble warrens, rookery-orcs, gutter-rats, ballista nests.
- **Hazards:** Dust chokes, falling mortar, “memory-gates” (doors that close behind memory—open if you recall a phrase).

### Rings 11–20: The Brass Labyrinth
Clockworks, locksmith saints, brass mites.
- **Hazards:** Gear-bind traps, sound lures, magnetic tides.

### Rings 21–40: The Fungal Courts
Spore courts ruled by **Mycel Duchess**.
- **Hazards:** Hallucigenic fog, spore pacts, cordyceps ambushes.

### Rings 41–60: The Black Aquifer
Underground rivers, salt knives, eel-knights.
- **Hazards:** Current pulls, pressure doors, cold shock.

### Rings 61–80: The Ember Ossuary
Bone-kilns, ash wraiths, slag golems.
- **Hazards:** Heat mirage, flash-flare runes, bone avalanches.

### Rings 81–99: The Quiet Choir
A cathedral complex humming with subsonic hymns.
- **Hazards:** Sound-stun, zealot automatons, confession levers that alter the map.

### Ring 100: The Never-King’s Seat
A voided amphitheater around the shard. The boss does not move; the arena does.
