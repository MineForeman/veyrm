# 14 â€” Progression Arcs

- **Seven Shards Campaign:** Each depth milestone reveals a shard-echo; collect all seven echoes to weaken the Never-King.
- **Order Reputation:** Complete Order bounties to unlock a signature technique (e.g., Red Anvil *Shield Wall*, Loomkeeper *Double-Weave*).
- **Vault Memory:** Vaults remember your choices; repeat delves can spawn *Remnants* (ghosts of your runs) that either aid or hunt you.
