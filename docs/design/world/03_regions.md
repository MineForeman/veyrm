# 03 — Regions of the Surface

## Veyrmspire
Black basalt city girdling the crater where the citadel fell.
- **Bazaar of Nails** (salvage market)
- **The Candle Basilica** (healer-priests)
- **The Red Anvil** (fighters’ yard)
- **Whispermarket** (rogues’ guild behind shuttered stalls)

## The Windbreak
Pine-clad escarpments north of the city; rangers’ posts, hawk-paths, thunder-bees.

## Saltglass Coast
South; tidal flats turned to fused glass by an old shard-pulse; wreck-mines and tide-mages.

## The Sunk March
Peat bogs pocked by sunken towers; peat-fires reveal vault vents (safeish entrances for early delves).
